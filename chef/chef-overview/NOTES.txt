* enforcing idempotence and convergence to handle indeterminate environment. let it crash and run again
* search and have one source of truth for your entire infrastructure. via chef server search
* manage your infrastructure like code. source control, code review,
  community libraries and tests. 
* A DSL for specifying your infrastructure. It is an abstraction. runs
